Database Systems 20277  2021b mmn 11
The project was written as part of the course " 20277 - Database Systems" in my degree (Computer Science at the Open University).


In this project I set up a database management system, PostgreSQL, a system for monitoring the sanitary condition of restaurants. In the project we were given information about all the key relationships and information for the tables.
Each file presents a task that I was asked to answer:
A. Define data types appropriate for the defined attributes.
B. A trigger that checks if there is a sanitary failure without detail.
third. Tasting data for each of the relationships.
D. Details of inspectors who have been working for at least 5 years.
2. Cases where the restaurant manager lives in the city where the restaurant is located but at a different address.
3. The number of inspections done for each restaurant last year.
4. Managers who live in Carmiel but do not have a restaurant in Carmiel.
5. For each of the 2021 months the inspectors who performed the highest number of inspections.
6. Inspectors who performed a sanitary inspection of each of the restaurants in Haifa.
7. From the inspectors who did not perform tests in Eilat, find the inspector who failed the largest number of tests.
